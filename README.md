# Audible Volume Control

### A simple Chrome extension to control the volume of your Audible book.

By default, the Audible web player does not offer any kind of volume control for playback. Fortunately, the player uses the standard `<audio>` tag to deliver the audio. This means we can target the player and set the volume attribute ourselves!
